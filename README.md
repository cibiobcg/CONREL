# Genome Browser in shiny for CONREL;

Webpage of the project at [bcglab.cibio.unitn.it/conrel/](http://bcglab.cibio.unitn.it/conrel/). The Genome Browser is containerized in a Singularity image - download of the image is available at the webserver.
All the data are available inside the singularity image.
The genome browser is implemented using a slightly modified version of the "Interactive visulizations for track-based genomic data in R" implemented by [Marlin-Na/TnT](https://github.com/Marlin-Na/TnT) and available at [ddalfovo/TnT](https://github.com/ddalfovo/TnT)

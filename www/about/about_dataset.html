CONREL v1 provides an extensive collection of consensus promoters, enhancers and active enhancers for 198 cell-lines across 38 tissue types, which are also combined to provide global consensuses. The consensus are defined by combining H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone markers from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Program (Roadmap) ChIP-seq peak data (data available as of September 2018 <a href="http://www.encodeproject.org" target="_blank">www.encodeproject.org</a>). Those ChIP-seq dataset has been mapped to GRCh37/hg19 human assembly. 1,000 Genomes Project genotype data (release 20130502, 2,504 individuals) and the total binding affinity of thousands of transcription factor binding motifs at genomic regulatory regions is here fully combined and exploited to characterize and annotate functional properties of our collection.

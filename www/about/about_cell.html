<h3><b>ChIP-seq data</b></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
ChIP-seq data from ENCODE (based on hg19 assembly) was downloaded for all cell lines with H3K4me1, H3K4me3 or H3K27ac histone markers peak data available. A total of 1398 ChIP-seq were available considering both narrowPeak and broadPeak datasets.
<br>
For each marker, peak regions were merged for sample replicates and then for different experiments of the same cell line. Consensus regions for each cell line were finally computed based on the markers providing a collection of global and specific CREs, for 38 tissue types and 198 different cell lines.
